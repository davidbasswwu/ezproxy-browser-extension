## EZproxy Domain Checker for Western Washington University

### What it does 🧐 
This Chrome browser extension makes it easy to access Library resources when the user is off-campus by checking the current domain against a list of EZproxy domains.

If the user is on a website that the Library has access to, the extension will automatically redirect them to the EZproxy version of the site, which allows them to authenticate using their library account.
