# EZProxy Extension - Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the EZProxy Extension and provides guidelines for maintaining security during development.

## Security Features

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)
- Strict CSP headers are set in both the manifest and HTML files
- Only allows scripts and resources from the extension's origin
- Restricts dangerous operations like `eval()` and `new Function()`
- Prevents clickjacking and other UI redressing attacks

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization
- All user inputs are validated and sanitized before processing
- URL validation ensures only valid HTTP/HTTPS URLs are processed
- HTML escaping prevents XSS attacks in dynamic content

### 3. Secure Storage
- Sensitive data is encrypted before storage
- Uses Web Crypto API for secure encryption/decryption
- Implements secure key management

### 4. Rate Limiting
- Prevents abuse of API endpoints
- Configurable rate limits for different types of requests
- Automatic cleanup of rate limiting state

### 5. CSRF Protection
- Implements anti-CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- Token rotation and expiration for enhanced security

## Development Guidelines

### Secure Coding Practices
- Always validate and sanitize user input
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Implement proper error handling without leaking sensitive information
- Follow the principle of least privilege for extension permissions

### Dependency Management
- Regularly update dependencies using `npm audit`
- Review and audit all third-party libraries
- Use lockfiles to ensure consistent dependency versions

### Testing
- Run security tests before each release
- Perform regular dependency audits
- Test for common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, etc.)

```bash
# Run security tests
npm test

# Audit dependencies
npm audit

# Check for known vulnerabilities
npx snyk test
```

## Security Headers

The following security headers are implemented:

- `Content-Security-Policy`: Restricts resource loading
- `X-Content-Type-Options`: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- `X-Frame-Options`: Prevents clickjacking
- `X-XSS-Protection`: Enables XSS filtering
- `Referrer-Policy`: Controls referrer information
- `Strict-Transport-Security`: Enforces HTTPS

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to security@example.com. Include:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Any relevant logs or screenshots
- Your contact information

We will respond to security reports within 48 hours.

## Security Checklist

- [ ] Security tests are passing
- [ ] No credentials are hardcoded
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] All security headers are properly set
- [ ] Rate limiting is properly configured
- [ ] CSRF protection is enabled for all state-changing operations
